Description: The Well-Plate Maker (WPM) is a shiny application deployed as an R 
    package. Functions for a command-line/script use are also available. The WPM 
    allows users to generate well plate maps to carry out their experiments 
    while improving the handling of batch effects. In particular, it helps 
    controlling the "plate effect" thanks to its ability to randomize samples 
    over multiple well plates. The algorithm for placing the samples is inspired
    by the backtracking algorithm: the samples are placed at random while 
    respecting specific spatial constraints.
